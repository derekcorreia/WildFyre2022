## Thanks and Acknowledgements
This project is really the culmination of conversations with many folks to make the ruleset better. What started as a simple "Make it possible to light 5x on any ball" and "Lighting the Spinner via player control" grew to a ruleset that adds some great ideas but keeps the overall scoring features of the game intact. I hope you enjoy it.

Ultimate thanks to Jordan Knights, who puts up with many pinball machines appearing at home and long nights of screaming at them.
